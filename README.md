# Time-Series-Analysis-Homework


### Background:
The financial departments of large companies often deal with foreign currency transactions while doing international business. As a result, they are always looking for anything that can help them better understand the future direction and risk of various currencies. Hedge funds, too, are keenly interested in anything that will give them a consistent edge in predicting currency movements.

In this project, I will test the many time-series tools in order to predict future movements in the value of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.


### Conclusions:

* After the regression analysis, we can conclude that the in sample data has a better performance because of smaller root mean squared error.

* Based on the time series analysis, we decided not to buy Japanese yen now because the risk of yen expected to increase.
